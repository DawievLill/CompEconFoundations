# Foundations of Computational Economics

This is a repository where I translate the code of Fedor Iskhakov's [Foundations of Computational Economics](https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon) from Python to Julia. The goal is to do this **within 30 days**. This will be done in the month of October after the workshop (16 October). I will try and journal my progress as far as possible. 

## Day 1

The general idea for this process is to gain an understanding of the key differences between Python and Julia, while also learning some new computational methods along the way. I will also try and track my hours for this, so that I don't spend too much time solving problems.  

- Mostly done with the replication of the Lecture 30 on the cake eating problem. **TODO**: Plotting.
- Learned about the **getindex** function and how to use in combination with **argmax**.
- Learned how to create a mask with respect to arrays, quite useful. 
- Finished the numbers exercise (Lecture 3) and learned about the [Decimals.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Decimals.jl) package.
- Read through the lecture on types (Lecture 4). All of this is pretty standard and easy to implement in Julia. have worked through this type of material before, so nothing surprising. 
- The **!** operator works on Booleans, functions and missing values. Similar to **not** in Python when it comes to Boolean values. Its operation on functions is mutation, if I remember correctly. 

## Day 2

Will continue on the 16th of October after workshop.
