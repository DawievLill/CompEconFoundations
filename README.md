# Foundations of Computational Economics

This is a repository where I translate the code of Fedor Iskhakov's [Foundations of Computational Economics](https://fedor.iskh.me/compecon) from Python to Julia. The goal is to do this **within 30 days**. This will be done in the month of September. I will try and journal my progress as far as possible. 

## Day 1

The general idea for this process is to gain an understanding of the key differences between Python and Julia, while also learning some new computational methods along the way. I will also try and track my hours for this, so that I don't spend too much time solving problems.  

- Mostly done with the replication of the Lecture 30 on the cake eating problem. 
- Started with the numbers exercise (Lecture 3). 

## Day 2
